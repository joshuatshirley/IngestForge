# IngestForge

Welcome to the official documentation for **IngestForge**, a modular Python framework for building mission-critical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications.

## 🚀 What is IngestForge?

IngestForge is designed for high-stakes research environments where data integrity, provenance, and precision are paramount. Unlike generic RAG solutions, IngestForge follows **NASA JPL's Power of Ten** rules for safety-critical software.

### Key Features
